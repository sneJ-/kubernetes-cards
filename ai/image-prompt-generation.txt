Hello, I'm creating an educative card game for beginners to learn Kubernetes.
I've already the basic card setup and would need propts for image generation for the background of said educative cards.
I've put following cards togehter, each has a catchy phrase.

- Service: Connecting Pods, Wherever They Are.
- Daemonset: One Pod Per Node, Always.
- Role: Scoped Permissions, Focused Control.
- ClusterRole: Cluster-Wide Permissions, Global Control.
- ConfigMap: Configuration at Your Fingertips.
- PersistentVolumeClaim: Claim Your Storage, Persist Your Data.
- Node: The Backbone of Your Cluster.
- Node Failure: A Node Goes Down - But the Cluster Stays Up!
- Ingress: Your Gateway to the Cluster.
- Pod: The Smallest Deployable Unit.
- ServiceAccount: Identity for Your Pods.
- CustomResourceDefinition: Extend Kubernetes, Your Way.
- Secret: Keep It Safe, Keep It Secret.
- StorageClass: Define Your Storage Strategy.
- Namespace: Organize and Isolate Your Resources.
- Disclosed CVE: A Vulnerability Is Found - Patch or Perish!
- IngressController: Traffic Control at the Edge.
- ReplicaSet: Keep Your Pods Running.
- RoleBinding: Linking Roles to Users.
- ClusterRoleBinding: Cluster-Wide Access Control.
- Job: Run to Completion.
- PersistentVolume: Provisioned Storage for Your Cluster.
- NetworkPolicy: Control Traffic, Secure Your Cluster.
- Pod Restart: A Pod Crashes - Kubernetes Brings It Back!
- Deployment: Manage and Scale Your Pods.
- Statefulset: Persistent Identity, Stable Storage.
- HorizontalPodAutoScaler: Scale with Demand.
- Group: Organize Users, Simplify Access.
- CronJob: Scheduled Tasks, Automated.
- EndpointSlice: Efficient Service Discovery.
- User: Access Control Starts Here.
- CustomResource: Tailored to Your Needs.

It would be good if the catchy phrase can be made part of the image if possible.
I'm looking for abstract background images, with different backgrounds per resource.
It would be good if all images would share the same theme. Lets go with a nautic theme first.
